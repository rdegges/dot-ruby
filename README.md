# dot-ruby

Dotfiles for managing Ruby.


## Installation

To install rbenv, ruby-build, and install the latest stable release of Ruby in
the proper way, run the following command. 

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdegges/dot-ruby/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

**NOTE**: This assumes you've got your shell environment set up to properly
have `rbenv` installed in `$PATH`, etc. If you don't, you should probably just
follow the official [rbenv installation instructions](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) yourself.
